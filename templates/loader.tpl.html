<div id="loader">
<!--
    If you wish to use a custom loader progress
    ui (we're just using the jqm loader), then
    here is where you would place its content.
    You would then also need to modify AppView
    to add this element to the DOM, and TourListView
    to change the displayLoader and removeLoader
    implementations.
