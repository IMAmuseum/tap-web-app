<p>By 1962, K&#363;boku retired from the fine arts circles of his early career and decided to turn his attention to creating kimono and especially obi. In these wearable works his style achieved its signature blend of modern and traditional elements with the appearance of a spontaneous Japanese ink brush painting.</p>
<p>This obi depicts water currents running around rocks, perhaps in a creek near K&#363;boku&#39;s home. It is a perfect encapsulation of the aesthetic and spiritual philosophy K&#363;boku spent his early career developing. This philosophy emphasized balance and a unifying life-force, owing much to Daoism. In the design, the quicker moving, heavier upper current is balanced by the more meandering lower one; the stationary rocks counterbalance the movement of the water. Each element depends on the other for the overall harmony of the design, one that shows K&#363;boku&#39;s deep sensitivity to nature&#39;s rhythms.</p>
