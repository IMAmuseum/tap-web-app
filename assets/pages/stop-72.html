<p>The kimono for winter stands out when compared to those of the other seasons. Spears of white plum blossoms rain down against a somber backdrop of deep black. The lack of color reflects the winter&#39;s harshness - a stark contrast to the colors of the kimono and obi of the other seasons. Unlike most of Hisako&#39;s kimono, which scatter the floral motif along the hem and on the sode, or sleeve, the plum blossoms dominate the entirety of the garment, almost overwhelming in their presence. </p>
<p>Plum trees and their blossoms are symbols of winter in Japan. Often the trees flower in January or February, when there is still snow on the ground. The delicate blooms, thriving amidst harsh winter elements, are often seen as symbols of perseverance through hardship. Perhaps this is why Hisako chose to gift the wearer of this kimono - and all who encounter her - with an abundance of these flowers.  </p>
<p>The triumph of the plum blossoms&#39; flowering, despite the winter, is also a potent symbol of the dedicated artistry of these two textile artists. In pursuing an ancient and difficult craft in a seemingly unreceptive era, they persevered to create dyed textiles of extraordinary grace.</p>
