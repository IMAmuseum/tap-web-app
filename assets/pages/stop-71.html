<p>For autumn, Hisako chose to memorialize an exuberantly Japanese seasonal flower: the cluster amaryllis. As the weather begins to cool, these spidery red blooms spring up in groups around the countryside. Hisako captures their explosion of color by inverting them: scattering white amaryllis flowers across a brilliantly red kimono. </p>
<p>When her father&#39;s cluster amaryllis design was featured on the cover of the Tosem Cloth Catalogue - the main source for the purchase of kimono and obi in Japan - it was a sign that K&#363;boku had achieved success as an obi-maker.</p>
<p>In Japanese, the flower&#39;s name is <em>higanbana</em>. <em>Bana</em> is related to <em>hana</em>, which means flower, and <em>higan</em> is a Buddhist holiday celebrated in Japan at both the Spring and Autumnal Equinox. It is a time for remembering ancestors and renewing one&#39;s commitment to Buddhism, making Hisako&#39;s kimono an especially fitting tribute to both the season and her father&#39;s legacy.</p>
