<p>K&#363;boku Takaku died in 1993, but his achievements lived on because he had an unusual successor: his adopted daughter, Hisako, who emerged as a renowned artist equal to her father.</p>
<p>This obi, created by Hisako, comes from the period just after the death of her parents. With a mountain looming in the background, it depicts the first row of riverside cherry treesâ€”called &#34;zensen&#34; cherry trees. Zensen is a military term meaning &#34;front line;&#34; because of their exposure to the elements, these cherry trees blossom first and then fade. Only then do the trees behind the zensen come into their own bloom. It seems fitting, then, that while this obi contains echoes of her father&#39;s style, the design is distinctly Hisako&#39;s own.</p>
