<p>Though K&#363;boku was deeply committed to using traditional techniques, he had the spirit of an innovator. As western art journals began to appear in Tokyo, he found himself enamored with the paintings of European cubists like Pablo Picasso, Juan Gris, and Georges Braque. Something in their minimalistic style and experiments with color and perspective spoke to him, and he abandoned the traditional style of his early works. Yet he still chose to depict a Japanese vegetable and label it &#34;great&#34; with the same Japanese character used to describe kings or gods. Despite the running tension between being either modern or traditional, by 1953 a viewer could almost mistake a dyed textile, like this one, for a cutting-edge painting by a Parisian modernist living 6,000 miles away. It is a 20th century phenomenon that K&#363;boku could take part in this evolving style without ever leaving Japan.</p>
