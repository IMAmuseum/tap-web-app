<p>One of the earliest surviving works by K&#363;boku features boys sumo wrestling near a river. It&#39;s a romanticized scene of the Japanese rural village ideal: some boys wrestle; others swim or fish. They are surrounded by images of indigenous Japanese plants and animals. This interest in inherently Japanese subjects would persist throughout K&#363;boku&#39;s career, even as, over the next twenty-five years, his visual style would undergo dramatic shifts. </p>
<p>The style he used at the outset of his career celebrates indigenous folk art and the traditional method of batik dyeing on cotton that yields forms with hard, well-defined outlines.  </p>
<p>K&#363;boku participated in the Pan-Asian movement in which artists and intellectuals reacted against westernizing and industrializing forces. He worked to preserve handcraftsman&#39;s skills and succeeded in elevating textile dyeing to the level of fine art. This work won a prize at Japan&#39;s prestigious annual government-sponsored Fine Arts exhibition in 1936.</p>
