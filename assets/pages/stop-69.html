<p>Hisako Takaku has created pictorial works for exhibition and her designs continue to be popular among the best kimono shops and wholesalers. But it is her suite of kimono and obi of the four seasons - completed over many years and presented together for the first time - that is perhaps her most brilliant achievement.

<p>This formal kimono is for spring. The blooms of the cherry blossom are highly anticipated signs of the season in Japan. Because of their vibrant but short period of peak beauty, they are often used in Japanese culture to evoke the ephemeral nature of life. In Hisako&#39;s visionary kimono, a wind scatters these cherry blossoms across vertical bands of black and mocha, capturing both the flowers&#39; beauty and the sadness that underlies their passing.</p>
