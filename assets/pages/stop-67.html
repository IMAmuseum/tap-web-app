<p>This design is another perfect place to see K&#363;boku&#39;s distinctive aesthetic philosophy at work. Instead of a stream, here he depicts mountains and wind-swept trees.  The motionless tree trunks are balanced by the blurred movement of their crowns. The two curved lines that make up the mountains balance one another, just as the two currents of water did in the obi with water current. With these forms and colors, K&#363;boku saw the underlying harmony he sought to capture.</p>
<p>Likewise, we can still see the elements he borrowed from European modernists in the chic minimalist style, but now more successfully balanced by the influence of Japanese Rinpa school paintings and spontaneous <em>sumi-e</em> brush painting. In the kimono and obi, K&#363;boku found his distinctly beautiful and long-sought expression of Japanese modernism.</p>
