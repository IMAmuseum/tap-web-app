<p>To represent summer, Hisako created this obi with a stylized water current design. It is the complement to her pale pink kimono adorned with swathes of blue poppies. Looking at both the kimono and obi, you can almost feel a cooling breeze. The effervescent water current design of this obi was inspired by K&#363;boku&#39;s obi of the same name. It provides us with an excellent opportunity to see how much these two artists share - in technique, style, and philosophy - and what distinguishes each. Here, Hisako&#39;s colors are warmer and her forms more looped and playful. Still she maintains the essential balance of opposites with the stronger gold lines playing off the more delicate silver strokes.</p>
